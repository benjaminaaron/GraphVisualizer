GraphVisualizer [Java]
===============

A simple graph visualizer to get into things around graphs.

I know programs like yEd do it just fine, but i was curious about the math behind it and wanted to challenge
myself to figure things out from scratch as they come along.

Some updates in the pipeline to make the code, the data structure and the math shorter and more elegant. 
This is the first step in a larger project for a creativity-stimulating graph-jump app something something
...stay tuned :)
